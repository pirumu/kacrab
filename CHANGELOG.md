## Unreleased

### Added

- Consumer client (`consumer` feature): `kacrab::consumer::Consumer` with manual
  partition assignment and classic consumer-group subscription. Fetch with
  `auto.offset.reset`, `max.poll.records`, and `seek`/`seek_to_beginning`/
  `seek_to_end`/`position`/`pause`/`resume`/`wakeup`; `FindCoordinator` +
  `JoinGroup`/`SyncGroup`/`Heartbeat`/`LeaveGroup` with the `range` assignor and
  eager rebalancing; `commit_sync`/`commit_sync_offsets`/`committed`/
  `group_metadata` (leader-epoch aware). Bytes-first records
  (`ConsumerRecord.key/value: Option<Bytes>`). Verified end-to-end against a real
  Apache Kafka 4.3.0 broker (manual assign + commit, a single subscriber, and two
  consumers rebalancing a topic).
- Config drift guard (`kacrab/tests/config_drift.rs`) cross-checking the typed
  `config/clients.rs` against the generated `config/catalog.rs`, so a Kafka
  version bump is regenerate-and-reconcile.
- `client.dns.lookup` is now honoured: broker hostnames are resolved on connect
  and every resolved address is tried under `use_all_dns_ips`.
- Consumer chapter in the book and `docs/consumer-design.md` design doc.

### Changed

- Broker DNS resolution moved into the wire layer (IPv4-first, multi-address
  fallback), replacing per-client address selection in the producer and consumer
  coordinator lookups.
- The three per-client `to_connection_config` methods now share one
  `connection_config_fields!` macro (~115 fewer lines), so a wire connection
  config is added in one place.

### Fixed

- The config-metadata generator now extracts `ConfigDef.define(...)` calls that
  Kafka breaks across lines (`).\n define(`), so `bootstrap.controllers` is
  cataloged.
- A group coordinator advertised as `localhost` resolving to an unreachable IPv6
  loopback no longer hangs the connection (see the wire DNS change above).

### Security

- Nothing yet.
